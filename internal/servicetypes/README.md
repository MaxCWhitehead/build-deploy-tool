# Service Types

Defines defaults for Lagoon service types, these replace the old helm based templates

This allows for the existing service types built with helm to be transferred over to a new templating system that allows easier customizability of resulting service types, and allows for the possibility of more flexible service type creation beyond the standard template offerings (additional port/services, multiple volumes, etc.)
